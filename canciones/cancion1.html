        <p>What do you mean?Oh, oh<br>
            When you nod your head yes<br>
            But you wanna say no<br>
            What do you mean? Hey-ey<br>
            When you don't want me to move<br>
            But you tell me to go<br>
            What do you mean?</p>

        <p>Oh, what do you mean?<br>
            Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?<br>
            Better make up your mind<br>
            What do you mean?</p>

        <P>You're so indecisive, what I'm saying<br>
            Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart<br>
            Don't know if you're happy or complaining<br>
            Don't want for us to end, where do I start?</P>

        <p>First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right<br>
            Wanna argue all day, making love all night<br>
            First you're up, then you're down and then between<br>
            Oh, I really wanna know</p>

        <p>What do you mean? Oh, oh<br>
            When you nod your head yes<br>
            But you wanna say no<br>
            What do you mean? Hey-yeah<br>
            When you don't want me to move<br>
            But you tell me to go<br>
            What do you mean?</p>

        <p>Oh, what do you mean?<br>
            Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?<br>
            Better make up your mind<br>
            What do you mean?</p>

        <p>You're overprotective when I'm leaving<br>
            Tryna compromise but I can't win<br>
            You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching<br>
            You had me from the start, won't let this end</p>

        <p>What do you mean? Oh, oh<br>
            When you nod your head yes<br>
            But you wanna say no<br>
            What do you mean? Hey-yeah<br>
            When you don't want me to move<br>
            But you tell me to go<br>
            What do you mean?</p>

            Oh, what do you mean?<br>
            Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?<br>
            (Oh baby)<br>
            Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?<br>

            But you wanna say no<br>
            What do you mean?<br>
            (You're so confusing baby) Hey-yeah<br>
            When you don't want me to move<br>
            But you tell me to go<br>
